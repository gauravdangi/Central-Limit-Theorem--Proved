# Central-Limit-Theorem--Proved
The central limit theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory that states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a 
finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the population.

mean(data) = mean(mean(Sample 1) + mean(Sample 2) + mean(Sample 3)+ ---- + mean(Sample n))
